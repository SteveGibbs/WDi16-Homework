<h1>The life of H. Marshall McLuhan</h1>

<div id="googleMap" style="width:500px;height:380px;"></div>

<h3>Birthplace: Edmonton, Canada</h3>
<p>Herbert Marshall McLuhan was born in Edmonton, Alberta, to Elsie Naomi (n√©e Hall) and Herbert Ernest McLuhan. His brother, Maurice, was born two years later. "Marshall" was a family name: his maternal grandmother's surname. Both of his parents were born in Canada.


<h3>Key Concepts - Tetrad</h3>
<p>In Laws of Media (1988), published posthumously by his son Eric, McLuhan summarized his ideas about media in a concise tetrad of media effects. The tetrad is a means of examining the effects on society of any technology (i.e., any medium) by dividing its effects into four categories and displaying them simultaneously. McLuhan designed the tetrad as a pedagogical tool, phrasing his laws as questions with which to consider any medium:</p>

<p>What does the medium enhance?<br>
What does the medium make obsolete?<br>
What does the medium retrieve that had been obsolesced earlier?<br>
What does the medium flip into when pushed to extremes?<br>
<p>The laws of the tetrad exist simultaneously, not successively or chronologically, and allow the questioner to explore the "grammar and syntax" of the "language" of media. McLuhan departs from his mentor Harold Innis in suggesting that a medium "overheats", or reverses into an opposing form, when taken to its extreme.</p>

<h3>Figure and Sound</h3>
<p>McLuhan adapted the Gestalt psychology idea of a figure and a ground, which underpins the meaning of "The medium is the message." He used this concept to explain how a form of communications technology, the medium or figure, necessarily operates through its context, or ground.</p>

<p>McLuhan believed that in order to grasp fully the effect of a new technology, one must examine figure (medium) and ground (context) together, since neither is completely intelligible without the other. McLuhan argued that we must study media in their historical context, particularly in relation to the technologies that preceded them. The present environment, itself made up of the effects of previous technologies, gives rise to new technologies, which, in their turn, further affect society and individuals.</p>
